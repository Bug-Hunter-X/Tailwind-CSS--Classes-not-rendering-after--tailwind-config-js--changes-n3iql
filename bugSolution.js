```javascript
//No code changes are needed in the javascript file. The solution lies in rebuilding your CSS.

//To fix this issue, run the following command in your terminal:
//npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch 
// (or your equivalent build process)

//This will regenerate the CSS file with the latest changes from your tailwind.config.js file.
